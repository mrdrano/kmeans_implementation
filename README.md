# kmeans_implementation
This is an implementation of kmeans algorithm without ML module
This dataset contains two data columns, “X” and “Y”, and one “cluster” column (1, 2, 3, and 4). In implementing K‐means,
use “X” and “Y” as features for clustering while the “cluster” column is for validation. 
Note that it is not necessary to perfectly clustering all of the data points into clusters.
Also note that the “cluster” column cannot be used in clustering.
